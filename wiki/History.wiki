#summary History of project

This project began while was on a EMBO Fellowship at the DKFZ in Heidleberg in the summmer of 2000. Heiko Schmidt convinced me that porting TreeView to Linux would be a good idea. 

The project makes use of an early version of Paul Lewis' Nexus Class Library (see [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg319 NCL: a C++ class library for interpreting data files in NEXUS format]). However the NCL code !TreeView X useshas diverged somewhat from the current [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ncl/ NCL project].
